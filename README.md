## Models

We release two versions of the DoctorIA model:

1. **DoctorIA-ClinicalReasoning**  
   - **Purpose**: Clinical reasoning and diagnostic support.  
   - **Tasks**: Symptom-to-diagnosis mapping, treatment planning, and evidence-based recommendations.  
   - **Quantization**: Available in 4-bit precision for reduced memory usage.  
   - **Hugging Face Repository**: [DoctorIA-ClinicalReasoning](https://huggingface.co/your-username/doctoria-clinical-reasoning)  

2. **DoctorIA-MedicalImageAnalysis**  
   - **Purpose**: Automated analysis of medical images (X-rays, MRIs, etc.).  
   - **Tasks**: Disease detection, lesion segmentation, and abnormality classification.  
   - **Quantization**: Available in 4-bit precision for reduced memory usage.  
   - **Hugging Face Repository**: [DoctorIA-MedicalImageAnalysis](https://huggingface.co/your-username/doctoria-medical-image-analysis)  

All models are released under the **Apache 2.0 License**.

## Organisation of the Repository

The repository is structured as follows:

- **`clinical_reasoning/`**: Contains the code and resources for the clinical reasoning model.
- **`medical_image_analysis/`**: Contains the code and resources for the medical image analysis model.
- **`examples/`**: Example scripts for inference, fine-tuning, and integration.
- **`datasets/`**: Links to datasets used for training and evaluation.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for experimentation and visualization.
- **`docs/`**: Additional documentation and tutorials.

---

## Requirements

To use DoctorIA, you will need:

- Python 3.8 or higher (Python 3.10 recommended).
- PyTorch (`torch`) and Transformers (`transformers`) libraries.
- GPU with at least 16GB of memory (for full-precision models).

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For quantized models (4-bit precision), ensure you have the `bitsandbytes` library installed:

```bash
pip install bitsandbytes
```

## Usage

### 1. Clinical Reasoning Model

Load the model and tokenizer:

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification

model_name = "your-username/doctoria-clinical-reasoning"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Example input
inputs = tokenizer("The patient presents with fever, cough, and shortness of breath.", return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model(**inputs)
predicted_diagnosis = outputs.logits.argmax().item()
print(f"Predicted Diagnosis: {predicted_diagnosis}")
```

### 2. Medical Image Analysis Model

Load the model and feature extractor:

```python
from transformers import AutoFeatureExtractor, AutoModelForImageClassification
from PIL import Image
import requests

model_name = "your-username/doctoria-medical-image-analysis"
feature_extractor = AutoFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForImageClassification.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Example input
url = "https://example.com/chest-xray.jpg"
image = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)
inputs = feature_extractor(images=image, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model(**inputs)
predicted_class = outputs.logits.argmax().item()
print(f"Predicted Class: {predicted_class}")
```

## Benchmarks

DoctorIA has been evaluated on several benchmarks to ensure its performance and reliability:

- **Clinical Reasoning**: Achieved **X% accuracy** on the DR.BENCH benchmark for clinical diagnostic reasoning.
- **Medical Image Analysis**: Achieved **Y% sensitivity** and **Z% specificity** on the CheXpert benchmark for chest X-ray analysis.
